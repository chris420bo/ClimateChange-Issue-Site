			<h1>About 350.org</h1>
			<p>350.org is a global environmental organization that focuses on addressing climate change and promoting climate action. The organization's name, "350," refers to the safe upper limit of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the Earth's atmosphere, measured in parts per million (ppm). Scientists widely agree that surpassing 350 ppm could lead to irreversible and dangerous climate impacts.
			<br><br>The organization was founded in 2008 by a group of environmentalists, including author Bill McKibben, to raise awareness about the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to push for policies that address climate change. They work to foster collaboration and coordination among diverse climate groups worldwide. They also support and amplify the efforts of local organizations and activists through partnerships, providing resources, and facilitating global campaigns.</p>
