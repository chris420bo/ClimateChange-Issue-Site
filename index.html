				<h2>What is climate change?</h2>
				<p>Climate change refers to the long-term shifts in Earth's climate patterns caused primarily by human activities, leading to impacts such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and ecological disruptions.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="content-box why">
			<h1>W<span>hy</span></h1>
			<div class="content">
				<h2>Why is climate change happening?</h2>
				<p>Climate change is happening primarily due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Human activities, including burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other GHGs, which trap heat and contribute to the warming of the planet.</p>

				<h2>Where is the planet being effected?</h2>
				<p>The effects of climate change are being observed worldwide. No region is unaffected by its impacts. Rising global temperatures are causing the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, leading to sea-level rise and threatening coastal areas. Changes in precipitation patterns are affecting water availability and agriculture. Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods are becoming more frequent and severe, impacting communities globally.</p>

				<h2>What can we do to stop climate change?</h2>
				<p>To stop climate change, collective action is necessary. We can mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This can be achieved by transitioning to renewable energy sources, promoting energy efficiency, adopting sustainable land-use practices, and promoting circular economy principles. Additionally, conserving forests and ecosystems, promoting sustainable transportation, and practicing responsible consumption and waste management are crucial steps in combating climate change.</p>

				<h2>Who can implement these changes?</h2>
				<p>Governments play a crucial role in implementing policies and regulations to reduce emissions, incentivize sustainable practices, and invest in renewable energy infrastructure. Businesses can contribute by adopting sustainable practices, reducing their carbon footprint, and investing in green technologies. Individuals also have a role to play by making sustainable choices in their daily lives, supporting renewable energy, and advocating for climate-friendly policies. International cooperation and partnerships between governments, organizations, businesses, and individuals are vital for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
